            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                1. I started my game development process by figuring out which JavaScript files would handle which aspects of my game.
                <br>2. I decided having three files would be the most organized and efficient architecture, one to handle the main game
                and its variables, one for the classes, and one with additional helper methods.
                <br>3. Next, it was time to create the structure for my main game file and create the classes. I decided to base the structure off of the Circle Blaster homework
                since the way the functions were broken up made logical sense to me.
                <br>4. Once my classes had proper constructors and the structure of the main game file was established it was time to start working on the collision methods. I had to create
                two custom collision detection methods due to the unique shapes of the stars. One was basic circle collision which was simple enough, and the other was collision for a circle with
                a sliver missing. This second collision detection method took me a considerable amount of time to figure out and still has some bugs.
            </p>
            <h2>Obstacles</h2>
            <p>
                The biggest obstacle I ran into was creating the collision for the stars. There are still many issues with the collision that I simply did not have enough time to trouble shoot,
                due to how late in the process I started working on the collision. The main issue with the collision was that the start and end angles in the star class were based off of a different
                coordinate plane than the angle from the star to the colliing entity, sadly I could not find a way to reliably reconcile the two in time. 
            </p>
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
                There are a few ways I would change my process for next time. First I would focus more on the collision methods and algorithms behind the gameplay first before working on aesthetics
                "game feel." I would also comment my code more consistently next time since it became hard to navigate my code towads the end of this project. Finally I would lower the scope for next
                time since I ended up having to rethink my entrie concept half way through.
