            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>
                Dodge through, and dive into randomly generated obstacles to diffuse them before they explode.
            </p>
            <h2>Genre</h2>
            <p>
                Astral Janitor is an action packed game that keeps players on their toes 
                by constantly giving them obstacles to avoid and disarm in an arcade style display.
            </p>
            <h2>Platform</h2>
            <p>
                Available only to desktop users.
            </p>
            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>
                Play as a worker from a dead star cleaning company, weave between and into
                dying stars to clean them up before they cause damage to, not only you, but the universe itself!
            </p>
            <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>
                Colors will have low saturation to create a visaullay pleasing and clean feel for the game.
            </p>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                Stars (shown on the screen as circles with a smaller core circle) will randomly appear on screen and start growing.
                Each star will have a randomly generated sliver taken out of it revealing its core. The player has to keep
                track of what stars are about to explode and decide which ones to prioritize. When the stars are smaller
                its more difficult to get to the center but its risky to wait until they are bigger since they might explode. 
                The player is controlled by the mouse to allow for fast and exact movement. There will be an instructions screen 
                in game to prepare players to become an astral Janitor.
            </p>
